## Why we chose this dataset
We chose the “Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024” dataset because it contains real and up-to-date information about music streaming trends, making it both relevant and easy to understand. Since music streaming is a familiar topic, it allows the results to be interpreted in a clear and intuitive way, which fits well with the goals of this assignment.

The dataset includes a combination of numerical variables such as Spotify streams, track score, popularity, and playlist-related metrics, along with categorical information like song title, artist, and release date. This structure made it suitable for practicing key data analysis tasks using Pandas, including data cleaning, aggregation, feature transformation, and exploratory data analysis.

During the analysis, the dataset required several preprocessing steps, such as converting text-based values into numerical format, handling missing values, and creating new derived columns like Spotify Streams (Millions). These steps helped us apply
